Headline: The reality television host said he is running for President. Here are
 his remarks from a speech given Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York City
Title : Donald Trump announces his candidacy for president during a rally at his
 Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in New York city on Tuesday June 16, 2015.

Wow. Whoa. That is some group of people. Thousands.

So nice, thank you very much. Thatâ€™s really nice. Thank you. Itâ€™s great to b
e at Trump Tower. Itâ€™s great to be in a wonderful city, New York. And itâ€™s a
n honor to have everybody here. This is beyond anybodyâ€™s expectations. Thereâ€
™s been no crowd like this.

And, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in. They didnâ€™t know the ai
r-conditioner didnâ€™t work. They sweated like dogs.

They didnâ€™t know the room was too big, because they didnâ€™t have anybody ther
e. How are they going to beat ISIS? I donâ€™t think itâ€™s gonna happen.

Our country is in serious trouble. We donâ€™t have victories anymore. We used to
 have victories, but we donâ€™t have them. When was the last time anybody saw us
 beating, letâ€™s say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the
 time. All the time.

When did we beat Japan at anything? They send their cars over by the millions, a
nd what do we do? When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesnâ
€™t exist, folks. They beat us all the time.

When do we beat Mexico at the border? Theyâ€™re laughing at us, at our stupidity
. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me.
 But theyâ€™re killing us economically.

The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody elseâ€™s problems.

Thank you. Itâ€™s true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends
 its people, theyâ€™re not sending their best. Theyâ€™re not sending you. Theyâ€
™re not sending you. Theyâ€™re sending people that have lots of problems, and th
eyâ€™re bringing those problems with us. Theyâ€™re bringing drugs. Theyâ€™re bri
nging crime. Theyâ€™re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.

But I speak to border guards and they tell us what weâ€™re getting. And it only 
makes common sense. It only makes common sense. Theyâ€™re sending us not the rig
ht people.

Itâ€™s coming from more than Mexico. Itâ€™s coming from all over South and Latin
 America, and itâ€™s coming probablyâ€” probablyâ€” from the Middle East. But we
 donâ€™t know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we donâ€
™t know whatâ€™s happening. And itâ€™s got to stop and itâ€™s got to stop fast.

Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East. Theyâ€™ve beco
me rich. Iâ€™m in competition with them.

They just built a hotel in Syria. Can you believe this? They built a hotel. When
 I have to build a hotel, I pay interest. They donâ€™t have to pay interest, bec
ause they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we shouldâ€™ve taken.

So now ISIS has the oil, and what they donâ€™t have, Iran has. And in 19â€” and 
I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I saidâ€” and I lo
ve the military, and I want to have the strongest military that weâ€™ve ever had
, and we need it more now than ever. But I said, â€œDonâ€™t hit Iraq,â€ because
 youâ€™re going to totally destabilize the Middle East. Iran is going to take ov
er the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out t
hat Iran is now taking over Iraq. Think of it. Iran is taking over Iraq, and the
yâ€™re taking it over big league.

We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion. We lost thousands of lives, thousands
 in Iraq. We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love â€” theyâ€™re great â€” a
ll over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers.

And we have nothing. We canâ€™t even go there. We have nothing. And every time w
e give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave i
t.

Last week, I read 2,300 Humveesâ€” these are big vehiclesâ€” were left behind fo
r the enemy. 2,000? You would say maybe two, maybe four? 2,300 sophisticated veh
icles, they ran, and the enemy took them.

Last quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic productâ€” a sign of stre
ngth, right? But not for us. It was below zero. Whoever heard of this? Itâ€™s ne
ver below zero.

Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978. But think of it, GDP belo
w zero, horrible labor participation rate.

And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent. Donâ€™t believe the
 5.6. Donâ€™t believe it.

Thatâ€™s right. A lot of people up there canâ€™t get jobs. They canâ€™t get jobs
, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs.
 They all have jobs.

But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21
 percent, and nobody talks about it, because itâ€™s a statistic thatâ€™s full of
 nonsense.

Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country ar
e getting weaker. Even our nuclear arsenal doesnâ€™t work.

It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old. They donâ€™t know
 if it worked. And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television
, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that 
look at us and they say, â€œThat is a group of people, and that is a nation that
 truly has no clue. They donâ€™t know what theyâ€™re doing. They donâ€™t know wh
at theyâ€™re doing.â€

We have a disaster called the big lie: Obamacare. Obamacare.

Yesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 5
5 percent, and deductibles are through the roof. You have to be hit by a tractor
, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, itâ€™s v
irtually useless. Itâ€™s virtually useless. It is a disaster.

And remember the $5 billion website? $5 billion we spent on a website, and to th
is day it doesnâ€™t work. A $5 billion website.

I have so many websites, I have them all over the place. I hire people, they do 
a website. It costs me $3. $5 billion website.

Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action. Nothingâ€™
s gonna get done. They will not bring usâ€” believe meâ€” to the promised land. 
They will not.

As an example, Iâ€™ve been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow 
Republicans. And theyâ€™re wonderful people. I like them. They all want me to su
pport them. They donâ€™t know how to bring it about. They come up to my office. 
Iâ€™m meeting with three of them in the next week. And they donâ€™t knowâ€” â€œA
re you running? Are you not running? Could we have your support? What do we do? 
How do we do it?â€

I like them. And I hear their speeches. And they donâ€™t talk jobs and they donâ
€™t talk China. When was the last time you heard China is killing us? Theyâ€™re 
devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldnâ€™t believe. It makes it imp
ossible for our companies to compete, impossible. Theyâ€™re killing us.

But you donâ€™t hear that from anybody else. You donâ€™t hear it from anybody el
se. And I watch the speeches.

I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon w
ill set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen. And people are saying, â€œWh
atâ€™s going on? I just want a job. Just get me a job. I donâ€™t need the rhetor
ic. I want a job.â€

And thatâ€™s whatâ€™s happening. And itâ€™s going to get worse, because remember
, Obamacare really kicks in in â€™16, 2016. Obama is going to be out playing gol
f. He might be on one of my courses. I would invite him, I actually would say. I
 have the best courses in the world, so Iâ€™d say, you what, if he wants toâ€” I
 have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac. If heâ€™d like to
 play, thatâ€™s fine.

In fact, Iâ€™d love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing
.

But Obamacare kicks in in 2016. Really big league. It is going to be amazingly d
estructive. Doctors are quitting. I have a friend whoâ€™s a doctor, and he said 
to me the other day, â€œDonald, I never saw anything like it. I have more accoun
tants than I have nurses. Itâ€™s a disaster. My patients are beside themselves. 
They had a plan that was good. They have no plan now.â€

We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can beâ€” andâ€” and it can be replaced with
 something much better for everybody. Let it be for everybody. But much better a
nd much less expensive for people and for the government. And we can do it.

So Iâ€™ve watched the politicians. Iâ€™ve dealt with them all my life. If you ca
nâ€™t make a good deal with a politician, then thereâ€™s something wrong with yo
u. Youâ€™re certainly not very good. And thatâ€™s what we have representing us. 
They will never make America great again. They donâ€™t even have a chance. Theyâ
€™re controlled fullyâ€” theyâ€™re controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the don
ors, and by the special interests, fully.

Yes, they control them. Hey, I have lobbyists. I have to tell you. I have lobbyi
sts that can produce anything for me. Theyâ€™re great. But you know what? it won
â€™t happen. It wonâ€™t happen. Because we have to stop doing things for some pe
ople, but for this country, itâ€™s destroying our country. We have to stop, and 
it has to stop now.

Now, our country needsâ€” our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a 
truly great leader now. We need a leader that wrote â€œThe Art of the Deal.â€

We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing,
 can bring back our military, can take care of our vets. Our vets have been aban
doned.

And we also need a cheerleader.

You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, â€œWell, the one thing, I th
ink heâ€™ll do well. I think heâ€™ll be a great cheerleader for the country. I t
hink heâ€™d be a great spirit.â€

He was vibrant. He was young. I really thought that he would be a great cheerlea
der.

Heâ€™s not a leader. Thatâ€™s true. Youâ€™re right about that.

But he wasnâ€™t a cheerleader. Heâ€™s actually a negative force. Heâ€™s been a n
egative force. He wasnâ€™t a cheerleader; he was the opposite.

We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great 
again. Itâ€™s not great again.

We needâ€” we need somebodyâ€” we need somebody that literally will take this co
untry and make it great again. We can do that.

And, I will tell you, I love my life. I have a wonderful family. Theyâ€™re sayin
g, â€œDad, youâ€™re going to do something thatâ€™s going to be so tough.â€

You know, all of my life, Iâ€™ve heard that a truly successful person, a really,
 really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public off
ice. Just canâ€™t happen. And yet thatâ€™s the kind of mindset that you need to 
make this country great again.

So ladies and gentlemenâ€¦I am officially runningâ€¦ for president of the United
 States, and we are going to make our country great again.

It can happen. Our country has tremendous potential. We have tremendous people.

We have people that arenâ€™t working. We have people that have no incentive to w
ork. But theyâ€™re going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social 
program is a job. And theyâ€™ll be proud, and theyâ€™ll love it, and theyâ€™ll m
ake much more than they wouldâ€™ve ever made, and theyâ€™ll beâ€” theyâ€™ll be d
oing so well, and weâ€™re going to be thriving as a country, thriving. It can ha
ppen.

I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. I tell you that.

Iâ€™ll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many pla
ces. Iâ€™ll bring back our jobs, and Iâ€™ll bring back our money.

Right now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion. We owe Japan more than tha
t. So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan 
us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so t
heir dealâ€™s even better.

How stupid are our leaders? How stupid are these politicians to allow this to ha
ppen? How stupid are they?

Iâ€™m going to tell youâ€” thank you. Iâ€™m going to tell you a couple of storie
s about trade, because Iâ€™m totally against the trade bill for a number of reas
ons.

Number one, the people negotiating donâ€™t have a clue. Our president doesnâ€™t 
have a clue. Heâ€™s a bad negotiator.

Heâ€™s the one that did Bergdahl. We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terroris
ts that everybody wanted over there.

We get Bergdahl. We get a traitor. We get a no-good traitor, and they get the fi
ve people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battl
efield trying to kill us. Thatâ€™s the negotiator we have.

Take a look at the deal heâ€™s making with Iran. He makes that deal, Israel mayb
e wonâ€™t exist very long. Itâ€™s a disaster, and we have to protect Israel. But
â€¦

So we need peopleâ€” Iâ€™m a free trader. But the problem with free trade is you
 need really talented people to negotiate for you. If you donâ€™t have talented 
people, if you donâ€™t have great leadership, if you donâ€™t have people that kn
ow business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contri
bution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free tr
ade terrible.

Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that ar
e stupid. We have people that arenâ€™t smart. And we have people that are contro
lled by special interests. And itâ€™s just not going to work.

So, hereâ€™s a couple of stories happened recently. A friend of mine is a great 
manufacturer. And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and
 I buy it. I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because t
hey devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody
 thought they could do it again.

But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everythingâ€” 
everything, they got away with it again. And itâ€™s impossible for our people he
re to compete.

So I want to tell you this story. A friend of mine whoâ€™s a great manufacturer,
 calls me up a few weeks ago. Heâ€™s very upset. I said, â€œWhatâ€™s your proble
m?â€

He said, â€œYou know, I make great product.â€

And I said, â€œI know. I know that because I buy the product.â€

He said, â€œI canâ€™t get it into China. They wonâ€™t accept it. I sent a boat o
ver and they actually sent it back. They talked about environmental, they talked
 about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it.â€

I said, â€œOh, wait a minute, thatâ€™s terrible. Does anyone know this?â€

He said, â€œYeah, they do it all the time with other people.â€

I said, â€œThey send it back?â€

â€œYeah. So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff. Theyâ€
™re not supposed to be doing that. I told them.â€

Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things o
ver there.

Ask Boeing. They wanted Boeingâ€™s secrets. They wanted their patents and all th
eir secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing.

Hey, Iâ€™m not saying theyâ€™re stupid. I like China. I sell apartments forâ€” I
 just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China. Am I supposed to
 dislike them? I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue 
of the Americas, that I got from China in a war. Very valuable.

I love China. The biggest bank in the world is from China. You know where their 
United States headquarters is located? In this building, in Trump Tower. I love 
China. People say, â€œOh, you donâ€™t like China?â€

No, I love them. But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can
â€™t sustain ourself with that. Thereâ€™s too muchâ€” itâ€™s likeâ€” itâ€™s like
 take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school
 football team. Thatâ€™s the difference between Chinaâ€™s leaders and our leader
s.

They are ripping us. We are rebuilding China. Weâ€™re rebuilding many countries.
 China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like i
t. They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small pota
toes. And theyâ€™re all over the place.

We have all the cards, but we donâ€™t know how to use them. We donâ€™t even know
 that we have the cards, because our leaders donâ€™t understand the game. We cou
ld turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly.

Now theyâ€™re going militarily. Theyâ€™re building a military island in the midd
le of the South China sea. A military island. Now, our country could never do th
at because weâ€™d have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist 
wouldnâ€™t let our countryâ€” we would never build in an ocean. They built it in
 about one year, this massive military port.

Theyâ€™re building up their military to a point that is very scary. You have a p
roblem with ISIS. You have a bigger problem with China.

And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexi
co.

So this man tells me about the manufacturing. I say, â€œThatâ€™s a terrible stor
y. I hate to hear it.â€

But I have another one, Ford.

So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, r
ips it out. Everybody thought the deal was dead. Reported it in the Wall Street 
Journal recently. Everybody thought it was a done deal. Itâ€™s going in and that
â€™s going to be it, going into Tennessee. Great state, great people.

All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announc
es theyâ€™re not going to Tennessee. Theyâ€™re gonna spend their $1 billion in M
exico instead. Not good.

Now, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion c
ar and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico. $2.5 billion, itâ€™s going
 to be one of the largest in the world. Ford. Good company.

So I announced that Iâ€™m running for president. I wouldâ€¦

â€¦ one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got inâ€” and I w
ouldnâ€™t even useâ€” you know, I haveâ€” I know the smartest negotiators in the
 world. I know the good ones. I know the bad ones. I know the overrated ones.

You get a lot of them that are overrated. Theyâ€™re not good. They think they ar
e. They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed. But theyâ€™re no
t good.

But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country. Be
lieve me, folks. We will do very, very well, very, very well.

But I wouldnâ€™t even waste my time with this one. I would call up the head of F
ord, who I know. If I was president, Iâ€™d say, â€œCongratulations. I understand
 that youâ€™re building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that youâ€
™re going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just fl
ow them across the border.â€

And you say to yourself, â€œHow does that help us,â€ right? â€œHow does that he
lp us? Where is that goodâ€? Itâ€™s not.

So I would say, â€œCongratulations. Thatâ€™s the good news. Let me give you the 
bad news. Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant th
at comes across the border, weâ€™re going to charge you a 35-percent tax, and th
at tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and thatâ€™s it.

Now, hereâ€™s what is going to happen. If itâ€™s not me in the position, itâ€™s 
one of these politicians that weâ€™re running against, you know, the 400 people 
that weâ€™re (inaudible). And hereâ€™s whatâ€™s going to happen. Theyâ€™re not s
o stupid. They know itâ€™s not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it. B
ut then theyâ€™re going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobby
ist for Ford and say, â€œYou canâ€™t do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of
 me and I take care of you, and you canâ€™t do that to Ford.â€

And guess what? No problem. Theyâ€™re going to build in Mexico. Theyâ€™re going 
to take away thousands of jobs. Itâ€™s very bad for us.

So under President Trump, hereâ€™s what would happen:

The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them
 the bad news. But it could be heâ€™d want to be cool, and heâ€™ll wait until th
e next day. You know, they want to be a little cool.

And heâ€™ll say, â€œPlease, please, please.â€ Heâ€™ll beg for a little while, a
nd Iâ€™ll say, â€œNo interest.â€ Then heâ€™ll call all sorts of political peopl
e, and Iâ€™ll say, â€œSorry, fellas. No interest,â€ because I donâ€™t need anyb
odyâ€™s money. Itâ€™s nice. I donâ€™t need anybodyâ€™s money.

Iâ€™m using my own money. Iâ€™m not using the lobbyists. Iâ€™m not using donors.
 I donâ€™t care. Iâ€™m really rich. I (inaudible).

And by the way, Iâ€™m not even saying thatâ€™s the kind of mindset, thatâ€™s the
 kind of thinking you need for this country.

Soâ€” because we got to make the country rich.

It sounds crass. Somebody said, â€œOh, thatâ€™s crass.â€ Itâ€™s not crass.

We got $18 trillion in debt. We got nothing but problems.

We got a military that needs equipment all over the place. We got nuclear weapon
s that are obsolete.

Weâ€™ve got nothing. Weâ€™ve got Social Security thatâ€™s going to be destroyed 
if somebody like me doesnâ€™t bring money into the country. All these other peop
le want to cut the hell out of it. Iâ€™m not going to cut it at all; Iâ€™m going
 to bring money in, and weâ€™re going to save it.

But hereâ€™s whatâ€™s going to happen:

After Iâ€™m called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns,
 after Iâ€™m called by all of the special interests and by theâ€” the donors and
 by the lobbyistsâ€” and they have zero chance at convincing me, zeroâ€” Iâ€™ll 
get a call the next day from the head of Ford. Heâ€™ll say. â€œPlease reconsider
,â€ Iâ€™ll say no.

Heâ€™ll say, â€œMr. President, weâ€™ve decided to move the plant back to the Uni
ted States, and weâ€™re not going to build it in Mexico.â€ Thatâ€™s it. They ha
ve no choice. They have no choice.

There are hundreds of things like that. Iâ€™ll give you another example.

Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day. $1 billion a day. I love the Saudis. M
any are in this building. They make a billion dollars a day. Whenever they have 
problems, we send over the ships. We say â€œweâ€™re gonna protect.â€ What are w
e doing? Theyâ€™ve got nothing but money.

If the right person asked them, theyâ€™d pay a fortune. They wouldnâ€™t be there
 except for us.

And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen. You remember Obama a year ago
, Yemen was a great victory. Two weeks later, the place was blown up. Everybody 
got outâ€” and they kept our equipment.

They always keep our equipment. We ought to send used equipment, right? They alw
ays keep our equipment. We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it wo
uld beâ€” we ought to send our surplus. Weâ€™re always losing this gorgeous bran
d-new stuff.

But look at that border with Saudi Arabia. Do you really think that these people
 are interested in Yemen? Saudi Arabia without us is gone. Theyâ€™re gone.

And Iâ€™m the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq. You know, a
ll of these politicians that Iâ€™m running against nowâ€” itâ€™s so nice to say 
Iâ€™m running as opposed to if I run, if I run. Iâ€™m running.

But all of these politicians that Iâ€™m running against now, theyâ€™re trying to
 disassociate. I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the q
uestion on Iraq. He couldnâ€™t answer the question. He didnâ€™t know. I said, â€
œIs he intelligent?â€

Then I looked at Rubio. He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thi
ng or bad thing? He didnâ€™t know. He couldnâ€™t answer the question.

How are these people gonna lead us? How are we gonnaâ€” how are we gonna go back
 and make it great again? We canâ€™t. They donâ€™t have a clue. They canâ€™t lea
d us. They canâ€™t. They canâ€™t even answer simple questions. It was terrible.

But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble. Now, thanks to fracking and other thing
s, the oil is all over the place. And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, 
and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cart
el kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders. They w
ere smarter than our leaders.

There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and t
herefore make it great again. Because we need money. Weâ€™re dying. Weâ€™re dyin
g. We need money. We have to do it. And we need the right people.

So Ford will come back. Theyâ€™ll all come back. And I will say this, this is go
ing to be an election, in my opinion, thatâ€™s based on competence.

Somebody said â€” thank you, darlinâ€™.

Somebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, â€œBut, Mr.
 Trump, youâ€™re not a nice person.â€

Thatâ€™s true. But actually I am. I think I am a nice person. People that know m
e, like me. Does my family like me? I think so, right. Look at my family. Iâ€™m 
proud of my family.

By the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, T
iffany, Evanka did a great job. Did she do a great job?

Great. Jared, Laura and Eric, Iâ€™m very proud of my family. Theyâ€™re a great f
amily.

So the reporter said to me the other day, â€œBut, Mr. Trump, youâ€™re not a nice
 person. How can you get people to vote for you?â€

I said, â€œI donâ€™t know.â€ I said, â€œI think that number one, I am a nice pe
rson. I give a lot of money away to charities and other things. I think Iâ€™m ac
tually a very nice person.â€

But, I said, â€œThis is going to be an election thatâ€™s based on competence, be
cause people are tired of these nice people. And theyâ€™re tired of being ripped
 off by everybody in the world. And theyâ€™re tired of spending more money on ed
ucation than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, a
nd we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education. And s
ome of them are like third world countries. But weâ€™re becoming a third word co
untry, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything. So on
e of the things I did, and I said, you know what Iâ€™ll do. Iâ€™ll do it. Becaus
e a lot of people said, â€œHeâ€™ll never run. Number one, he wonâ€™t want to giv
e up his lifestyle.â€

Theyâ€™re right about that, but Iâ€™m doing it.

Number two, Iâ€™m a private company, so nobody knows what Iâ€™m worth. And the o
ne thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of 
governmental authorities your net worth.

So I said, â€œThatâ€™s OK.â€ Iâ€™m proud of my net worth. Iâ€™ve done an amazin
g job.

I started offâ€” thank youâ€” I started off in a small office with my father in 
Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said â€” and I love my father. I learned so m
uch. He was a great negotiator. I learned so much just sitting at his feet playi
ng with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors. But I learned a l
ot.

But he used to say, â€œDonald, donâ€™t go into Manhattan. Thatâ€™s the big leagu
es. We donâ€™t know anything about that. Donâ€™t do it.â€

I said, â€œI gotta go into Manhattan. I gotta build those big buildings. I gotta
 do it, Dad. Iâ€™ve gotta do it.â€

And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lo
t of great dealsâ€” the Grand Hyatt Hotel. I was responsible for the convention 
center on the west side. I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and yo
ung. And now Iâ€™m building all over the world, and I love what Iâ€™m doing.

But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, â€œWell, Donald will neve
r run, and one of the main reasons is heâ€™s private and heâ€™s probably not as 
successful as everybody thinks.â€

So I said to myself, you know, nobodyâ€™s ever going to know unless I run, becau
se Iâ€™m really proud of my success. I really am.

Iâ€™ve employedâ€” Iâ€™ve employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime.
 That means medical. That means education. That means everything.

So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, beca
use itâ€™s big and complex, and theyâ€™ve put together a statement, a financial 
statement, just a summary. But everything will be filed eventually with the gove
rnment, and we donâ€™t [use] extensions or anything. Weâ€™ll be filing it right 
on time. We donâ€™t need anything.

And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, â€œHe had ass
ets of $9 billion.â€ So I said, â€œNo, thatâ€™s the wrong number. Thatâ€™s the 
wrong number. Not assets.â€

So they put together this. And before I say it, I have to say this. I made it th
e old-fashioned way. Itâ€™s real estate. You know, itâ€™s real estate.

Itâ€™s labor, and itâ€™s unions good and some bad and lots of people that arenâ€
™t in unions, and itâ€™s all over the place and building all over the world.

And I have assetsâ€” big accounting firm, one of the most highly respectedâ€” 9 
billion 240 million dollars.

And I have liabilities of about $500 million. Thatâ€™s long-term debt, very low 
interest rates.

In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, â€œDonald, you donâ€™t have e
nough borrowings. Could we loan you $4 billionâ€? I said, â€œI donâ€™t need it.
 I donâ€™t want it. And Iâ€™ve been there. I donâ€™t want it.â€

But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted. So I have a total net worth,
 and now with the increase, itâ€™ll be well-over $10 billion. But here, a total 
net worth ofâ€”net worth, not assets, notâ€” a net worth, after all debt, after 
all expenses, the greatest assetsâ€” Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, B
ank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to 
as the Trump building right opposite the New Yorkâ€” many other places all over 
the world.

So the total is $8,737,540,00.

Now Iâ€™m not doing thatâ€¦

Iâ€™m not doing that to brag, because you know what? I donâ€™t have to brag. I d
onâ€™t have to, believe it or not.

Iâ€™m doing that to say that thatâ€™s the kind of thinking our country needs. We
 need that thinking. We have the opposite thinking.

We have losers. We have losers. We have people that donâ€™t have it. We have peo
ple that are morally corrupt. We have people that are selling this country down 
the drain.

So I put together this statement, and the only reason Iâ€™m telling you about it
 today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another thr
ee or four yearsâ€” you know, weâ€™re at $8 trillion now. Weâ€™re soon going to 
be at $20 trillion.

According to the economistsâ€” who Iâ€™m not big believers in, but, nevertheless
, this is what theyâ€™re sayingâ€” that $24 trillionâ€” weâ€™re very closeâ€” th
atâ€™s the point of no return. $24 trillion. We will be there soon. Thatâ€™s whe
n we become Greece. Thatâ€™s when we become a country thatâ€™s unsalvageable. An
d weâ€™re gonna be there very soon. Weâ€™re gonna be there very soon.

So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly. I would repeal and r
eplace the big lie, Obamacare.

I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, 
and Iâ€™ll build them very inexpensively, I will build a great, great wall on ou
r southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.

Mark my words.

Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump. Nobody.

I will find â€” within our military, I will find the General Patton or I will fi
nd General MacArthur, I will find the right guy. I will find the guy thatâ€™s go
ing to take that military and make it really work. Nobody, nobody will be pushin
g us around.

I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons. And we wonâ€™t be using a man lik
e Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, whoâ€™s making 
a horrible and laughable deal, whoâ€™s just being tapped along as they make weap
ons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and 
breaks his leg. I wonâ€™t be doing that. And I promise I will never be in a bicy
cle race. That I can tell you.

I will immediately terminate President Obamaâ€™s illegal executive order on immi
gration, immediately.

Fully support and back up the Second Amendment.

Now, itâ€™s very interesting. Today I heard it. Through stupidity, in a very, ve
ry hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vic
ious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are. And a woman was on televis
ion this morning, and she said, â€œYou know, Mr. Trump,â€ and she was telling o
ther people, and I actually called her, and she said, â€œYou know, Mr. Trump, I 
always was against guns. I didnâ€™t want guns. And now since this happenedâ€â€”
 itâ€™s up in the prison areaâ€” â€œmy husband and I are finally in agreement, b
ecause he wanted the guns. We now have a gun on every table. Weâ€™re ready to st
art shooting.â€

I said, â€œVery interesting.â€

So protect the Second Amendment.

Endâ€” end Common Core. Common Core shouldâ€” it is a disaster. Bush is totally 
in favor of Common Core. I donâ€™t see how he can possibly get the nomination. H
eâ€™s weak on immigration. Heâ€™s in favor of Common Core. How the hell can you 
vote for this guy? You just canâ€™t do it. We have to end education has to be lo
cal.

Rebuild the countryâ€™s infrastructure.

Nobody can do that like me. Believe me. It will be done on time, on budget, way 
below cost, way below what anyone ever thought.

I look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build thos
e things for one-third. What they do is unbelievable, how bad.

You know, weâ€™re building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, weâ€™re 
converting it into one of the worldâ€™s great hotels. Itâ€™s gonna be the best h
otel in Washington, D.C. We got it from the General Services Administration in W
ashington. The Obama administration. We got it. It was the most highly sought af
terâ€” or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the h
istory of General Services. We got it. People were shocked, Trump got it.

Well, I got it for two reasons. Number one, weâ€™re really good. Number two, we 
had a really good plan. And Iâ€™ll add in the third, we had a great financial st
atement. Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and 
talented people, they wanted to do a great job. And they wanted to make sure it 
got built.

So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airport
s. You come into La Guardia Airport, itâ€™s like weâ€™re in a third world countr
y. You look at the patches and the 40-year-old floor. They throw down asphalt, a
nd they throw.

You look at these airports, we are like a third world country. And I come in fro
m China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they h
ave the most incredible airports in the world. You come to back to this country 
and you have LAX, disaster. You have all of these disastrous airports. We have t
o rebuild our infrastructure.

Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts. Have to do it.

Get rid of the fraud. Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it. People have b
een paying it for years. And now many of these candidates want to cut it. You sa
ve it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all o
f the money thatâ€™s being lost.

Renegotiate our foreign trade deals.

Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, weâ€™re in a bubble. We ha
ve artificially low interest rates. We have a stock market that, frankly, has be
en good to me, but I still hate to see whatâ€™s happening. We have a stock marke
t that is so bloated.

Be careful of a bubble because what youâ€™ve seen in the past might be small pot
atoes compared to what happens. So be very, very careful.

And strengthen our military and take care of our vets. So, so important.

Sadly, the American dream is dead.

But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and strong
er than ever before, and we will make America great again.

Thank you. Thank you very much.
