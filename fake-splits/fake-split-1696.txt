I had one friend that came into my office – I don’t think I’ve ever said this before. He came into my office. He wanted to give me millions of dollars. I said, "I can’t take your money. I don’t want your money. I’m self-funding." He said, "No, no, no, you’ve got to be kidding." He didn’t even know. He thought I was kidding. He wanted to endorse me, wanted to support me. I said no, no, I don’t want. Anyway, he was finally convinced that I didn’t want his money and he’s leaving. And I said, "By the way, what are you going to do now?" He said, "I’m going to give it to another candidate." And I said, "Why?"
