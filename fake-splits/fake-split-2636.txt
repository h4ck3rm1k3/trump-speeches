Now the debates used to be – you go back four years or eight years, you know whenever the cycles came up, nobody even wanted it – they didn’t want the debates. I think they were forced to take them for licensing. Nobody wanted the debates...But now they’re drawing 24 million. Now they want to have more debates. "Oh, can we have more? Can we have more? Can they go three hours?" Remember? When they had the one go three hours? I said, "No, I’m not doing three hours. It’s too long." Who wants – I could stand up here for 50 hours but who the hell wants to sit home watching three hours of this stuff? Right?
