It’s interesting. I have thousands of people who work for me. Thousands. And they’re people that come from far – they’re all here legally. Don’t worry about it. I use e-verify. But I have people – oh, they go and check. These guys go check. They went into the Old Post Office, checking everybody. "Are you here illegally? Are you here illegally?"
