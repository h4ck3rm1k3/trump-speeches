So when I talk and when I’m up on the stage with these guys, these people, wonderful people and a very nice woman, Carly, she’s a nice woman. When I’m up on the stage with them, they think I’m crazy when I say Mexico. I would say, "We’re going to build a wall. It’s going to be a great wall. It’s going to be a real wall." See this ceiling? This ceiling is peanuts compared to the height of the wall I’m talking about. I’m talking about if they ever get up there, they’re not coming down because it’s too dangerous. All right?
