So I made this deal and it was great. And they called. They did a story on me recently and it was a nice story. And I said, I hope they don’t call this guy. They ended up calling this guy "What do you think about Trump?" And he said but in a respectful way, he said "He won because he was so damn unpredictable. We don’t know what the hell he was going to do." That’s a positive. That’s a positive.
