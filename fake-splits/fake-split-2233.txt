So again, I just want to congratulate everybody. This is a really interesting process. It’s an amazing process. It’s very tough. But it is – by the end, if you get to the end, you can handle a lot of things including pressure because there’s nothing like it. Lies, deceit, viciousness, disgusting reporters, horrible people. It’s true. Some are nice. Some are nice. Some really disgusting people back there.
