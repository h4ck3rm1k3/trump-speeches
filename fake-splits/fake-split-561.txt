I don’t want to wait for your freaking Applause. We have — I have so many — we have so much potential. There are so many things to do. I don’t really sort of want to wait. I want to do it. And I just noticed, I did it again. You were getting ready to give a big Applause, because you like that, and I’m speaking. I killed the Applause. But he is right. But except, I’m not a speaker. What I am is a doer. I get things done.
