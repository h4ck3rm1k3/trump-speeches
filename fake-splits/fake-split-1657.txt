You know, a lot of friends come up to me and they say, "Donald, let me ask you a question. These politicians – are they really that dumb?" I said, "No, they’re not actually that dumb. Some are. But they’re not actually that dumb. They’re all taken care of by the special interests. And when you want something done, you see certain people in Washington."
