Just so you understand. When I didn’t do the Fox debate...because I didn’t think they treated me right but actually they’ve been extremely fair over the last three or four months, I have to say that about Fox. But when I didn’t do that one event, the debate, I gave a speech. I didn’t have to do this with the money for the vets but I decided to because I thought it would be a good idea.
