And that’s why — and one of the beautiful polls that came out, and I’m so proud of it, CNN just came out with a poll a couple of, I guess a week ago — 36 percent for Trump; second is 16; third is 14; then 12. So they’re way down. But on the economy, they give me 55 — 55 percent. That’s with 16 people at the time.
