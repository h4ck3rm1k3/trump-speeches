Okay, so Gaddafi, they backed rebels who end up killing the Ambassador and the other young people. You know, the Ambassador was riding in a Jeep. One of our Jeeps, of course. A military Jeep, holding the Libyan flag, and you know, "Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!" and then he gets killed by the same people.
