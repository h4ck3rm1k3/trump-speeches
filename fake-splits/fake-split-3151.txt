A woman said to me in New Hampshire recently, she said, "Mr. Trump, I’m voting for you. I love you. But it’s very crude when you say you’re going to make our country rich again." I said, "I know it’s crude. It sounds bad. But many things I say are crude. It sounds bad. But we can’t make our country great again unless we make our country rich again. We can’t let everybody in the world rip us off."
