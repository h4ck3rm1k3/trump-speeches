That’s a little bit like what I’m doing. I’m the least spent money. You know, I’m funding my own campaign. Right? So, I don’t have a lot of the people coming to me. You know, the drug companies and all of the – because if you would see the kind of waste, fraud, and corruption in the United States, a lot of it isn’t really waste, fraud, and corruption. It’s the fact that people that are running against me and people in the Senate, people in Congress, they have tremendous power because they have people giving them unbelievable campaign contributions and they’re special interests and they do what those people want. And that’s one of the reasons why our budget is out of whack, the military is out of whack. The military orders equipment they don’t even want and the stuff they do want they don’t get because the company that makes that equipment is like, you know, it’s not politically adept, and companies that really are, they make the equipments we don’t want. It’s going to all change because I’m not getting any money from all of these people. I don’t give a damn. I mean, we’re going to do the right thing. We’re going to absolutely do the right thing.
