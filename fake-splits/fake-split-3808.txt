What happened is they sent this incredible photographer up to do a book cover, do to a picture. And he did some great…photos. I’m smiling. I’m happy. I look good. Everything was fine. And then he took one where I wasn’t like really thinking about a photo and then it turned out to be a nasty picture. And then the book was written and the title was given and the only really terrible picture I had was that one. It’s a terrible, horrible, nasty picture. But when you’re talking about "Crippled America" and you’re talking about all of the problems we have, I can’t have a big smiley face up there. So that’s how we picked it. We picked the worst photo taken of me.
