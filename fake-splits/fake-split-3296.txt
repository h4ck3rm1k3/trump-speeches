…We have such a problem. And the biggest problem I have, you know, it relates to education and the hardest thing you get is when you go around and you’d see students and so many students come out to hear us and they always want to talk about the loans – they have student loans – and they’re going through nice colleges, they’re good students, they work hard, they could be really top in their class and they get out and they say, "Mr. Trump, we have no jobs. We can’t get jobs."
