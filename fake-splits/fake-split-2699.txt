So what happens? So we have ISIS taking a lot of the oil. I said, "Take the oil." Remember, when we left – I was opposed going in because I said you’re going to destabilize the Middle East because you had Iraq and you had Iran. And I said, they’ll fight. They’re always fighting, for decades and decades, for generations. They fight. That’s what they do. They fight.
