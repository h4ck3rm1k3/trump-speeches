In the case of Jeb Bush, you’re not supposed to deal with these Super PACs. Okay? So, it was in the Wall Street Journal the other day. He has a Super PAC fundraiser or something in a hotel and right next to it, he had his campaign ballroom. Did you read that? Two ballrooms. One here, one here, right next to each other by coincidence, of course. They’re not supposed to be coordination. They’re not supposed to be talking. They’re right next to each other. And that’s nothing compared to what some are doing.
