The CNN poll was 33% for Trump, 20% for Chris. Nobody talks about it. Nobody talks about it. They don’t talk about it. They talk about – CNN is reporting other people’s polls. So, I call up. I say, "Wait a minute. You’re CNN. You spent a fortune on polls and you don’t report your own polls because I’m winning by a lot." And they have no excuse but they keep reporting other polls. But we’re doing well. I think we’re doing a lot better than anyone knows.
