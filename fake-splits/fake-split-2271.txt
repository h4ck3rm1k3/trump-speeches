You better believe it. We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion. And these characters come up, these politicians that I’m running against, "You don’t really think Mexico is going to pay for the wall?" I said, "Absolutely, 100%." They said, "How are you going to get Mexico to pay?" And I don’t want to get into it because they won’t understand it. I mean, they have no concept of business. They have no – you know, the $150 billion we gave to Iran, these people have no concept.
