And then what happened – I ran against all these Senators and Governors. And everyone said "Well, I don’t know." My wife said "If you run, you’re going to win" because she understands that I like people – I love people and people love me. And she said "You will run but you actually have to go and run. You have to announce you’re running because nobody’s going to believe you’re running."
