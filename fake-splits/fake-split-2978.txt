I actually said — it’s funny. The other day I got this great review. They said trump is a great speaker. The crowd is spellbound. But he has one problem. And I’m reading, and I want to see. The problem is, he speaks through the Applause. In other words, like I say that, you applaud, I start talking you finish your Applause. And you know why? Because I’m so excited, because we have so much potential. It’s true.
