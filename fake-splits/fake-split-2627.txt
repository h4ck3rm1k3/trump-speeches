And that’s what I do like saying about my campaign. I spend less money than anybody else and I have the best result. I’m number one by a lot and I spend no money. I mean, my plane costs me some money but I spend no ads. Took a little radio ad in Iowa. But I didn’t do that. I think the station is so lovely if you want to know the truth. But I spend essentially no money and then you have all these other guys spending vast – and they’re like the way the United States is run.
