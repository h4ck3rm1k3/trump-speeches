When I say "Mexico is going to pay," they all laugh. They all go "heh, heh, heh." They think it’s funny. Honestly, these are people — they think it’s funny. They’re laughing. You know, lightly, like "Oh ho, that’s so funny; ha, ha, ha." They’re going to pay for the wall, folks. They’re making billions and billions and billions of dollars on deficits that we have with Mexico. The wall is peanuts. They’re going to pay for the wall.
