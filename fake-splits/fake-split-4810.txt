You know, Trace came onto The Apprentice. And I said, "Who the hell is he? Who is he?" I didn’t know who Trace was. I’d never heard of him. And he wasn’t a big name. And he came on – just to show you how important this show is and his record or album or whatever you call it now…it went to number one. And then he came to me the next year…but Trace came to me and he goes – you know, at certain awards show, I won’t mention the name – but he said "Last year, I couldn’t get into the show and this year I’m hosting it, Mr. Trump, all because of you."
