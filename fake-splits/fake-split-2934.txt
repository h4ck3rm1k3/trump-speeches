We have now migrations ,largely because of what’s happened afterwards. You know Iraq was horrible. It was stupid to go in and we should have never gone in. But we shouldn’t have gotten out the way we went out. And we shouldn’t have given dates. I mean, I would have probably said we are going to stay forever. And they would have said, oh, man.
