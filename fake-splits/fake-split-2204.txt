I want to pay my respects by the way to Todd Palin, Sarah’s husband. Sarah was here. She was incredible. She was making a speech on my behalf and fantastic and everybody loves her. And what happened is he was in a very bad accident. He’s tough as nails. He’s going to be fine. But I just wanted to pay my respects by the way to Todd.
