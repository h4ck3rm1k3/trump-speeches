But what happened is I won by 20 points – almost 20 points – and a lot of these issue we were talking about it was big issues. And frankly, I wish I would have left about two days earlier. I wanted to stay in Florida campaign. I wish I would have devoted two more days to Ohio because I almost won in Ohio. I would have won in Ohio but I didn’t want to take a chance leaving my beautiful Florida because I love Florida and I wanted to win that.
