But global warming – you noticed they changed the name – they go global warming, they go climate change, they go – now I hear a lot of extreme weather. How can you miss with extreme weather, right? If it’s cold, it’s okay. If it’s hot, it’s okay. If it’s windy, if it’s hot – everything is extreme. So now they use extreme weather. It is a disgrace what’s going on.
