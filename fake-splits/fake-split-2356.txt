But I don’t know – I was talking to Scott about this before – I don’t know it’s really appreciated by the voters. I’m the only one on both sides that’s self funding. I’m putting up my own money. And I don’t know that the voters appreciate it. When they go into vote, I don’t think they say "I’m going to vote for Trump because he’s self-funding and he’s not going to be influenced by lobbies and special interests et cetera."
