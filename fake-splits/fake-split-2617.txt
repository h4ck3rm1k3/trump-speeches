We’ve got to fix our health care program. This Obamacare is a disaster. You people know. You people know...It’s going to be repealed and replaced. It will die in ’17 anyways. I don’t know if you’ve heard what’s happening but it’s so bad all the people that they didn’t think were signing up are signing up and the other people that are really paying for it aren’t signing up. And your rates are going up 25%, 35%, 45%. Your deductibles are so high that unless you get hit by a tractor, you’re never going to be able to use your deductible. You’re never going to be able to use it.
