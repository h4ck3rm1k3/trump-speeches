The whole thing with Super PACs is a horrible, horrible scam. So I sent letters last week to as many as we could find. They’re all over the place. We want you to close the Super PAC. We want nothing to do with it. We don’t want to get advertisements. We don’t want any of the money. Go home and ideally give the money back. They don’t even have to give the money back from what I understand. They can keep it. They’ll probably if they actually raised money for me, they’ll say "What a horrible thing he just said. I think we’re going to support somebody else." They could do that.
