Millions of people are coming in to vote. This was an example of it today. Many, many more people. I’m looking at the polling booths. I’m looking at the different polling booths all around the country where it’s up. And the lines are four, five, six blocks long. And the woman – one woman was there for 40 years. She’s been working the polls. And she said, "We’d have two people here. We’d have three people. Now look at the line." And the line looked like it was, you know, long. It was really long. Five deep and long. And it’s just a different thing.
