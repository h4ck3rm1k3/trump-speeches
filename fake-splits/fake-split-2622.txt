When I look at parents and I see local parents in Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina – I went to a school and I saw the parents, they love their children. They want to educate – they love – they don’t care about money. They don’t care about anything. They love their children. And it’s local. And they get together and they do wonderful programs. They’re smart people. As opposed to getting it done by bureaucrats that are getting big fat checks in Washington. I mean, we have such talent in this country and we don’t use it.
