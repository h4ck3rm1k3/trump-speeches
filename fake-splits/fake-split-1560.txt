And I actually spoke to one today who was vicious. I mean, this guy was unbelievable. And I said, "I’d love having you and I think it’s terrific. But after what you said about me how can you possibly join our team?" And he said, "Mr. Trump, don’t even think about it. Don’t worry about it. There’ll be no problem." In other words, he’s a politician; there’s no problem. I would have had a hard time.
