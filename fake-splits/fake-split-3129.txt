Now, you have Rubio – nice guy, by the way. You have Rubio and he is a nice guy but you’ve got to vote. When people put you in a position to be a Senator, you’ve got to go and vote. You can’t be the number one person that doesn’t vote in the Senate. You’ve got to say, "Hey, I’m a young guy. I want to go and vote." You should stay there a little longer. He’s a good guy. Stay there, go in, vote, create a nice record.
