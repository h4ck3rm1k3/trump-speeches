But why are we leading the fight? Putin hates us. He hates Obama. He doesn’t hate us. I think he’d like me. I’d get along great with him I think if you want to know the truth. No, he has no respect for our President and our President doesn’t like him in all fairness. They don’t have good chemistry to put it mildly, would you say. But I’d get along with these people.
