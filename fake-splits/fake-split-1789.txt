You know, one of the great writers called me up and he said, "What you’ve done is incredible." I said, "No, no, I have to win." He said, "No, no, it makes no difference. If you win, if you lose, it doesn’t matter. What you’ve done is down in the history books. You will be cover for all time. It’s incredible." I said, "No, sir. No, sir. I have to win. Because if I don’t win, to me, I will consider it a tremendous waste of time and waste of money but a tremendous waste of time."
