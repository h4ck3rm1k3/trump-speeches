Miss Universe, by the way, made a great deal when I sold it. Oh, did I get rich. That was a great deal. You know, they broke my choppers on that. They said "He talks about illegal immigration. We’re not going to put him on television." First of all, Univision is being sued like crazy. You wouldn’t believe it. And NBC I made a great deal with them. Just like an amazing deal. Far more than it would have ever gotten. I made an unbelievable deal. Far more than I ever would have gotten if I said "I think I’m going to sell it if times were normal." Isn’t it amazing the way this stuff could work out? But I love Miss Universe and I love the universe.
