So instead of saying they made a mistake, call it a typo, they made a mistake, they’re trying to justify it. "Well, we meant we’re working on it." Can you believe? Bringing peace to Syria. The world is blowing up. The migration in Syria. They say one of their achievements of the year is bringing peace to Syria. And the whole world is talking about it. It’s the level of stupidity is incredible.
