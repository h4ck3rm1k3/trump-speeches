I received a call from one of the biggest reporters who happens to be liberal but that’s okay. We can have a couple of them. Right? But a guy who’s really respected. Recently. And he said, "How does it feel?" I said "How does what feel?" He said, "What you have done has never been done in the history of politics in the United States."
