And then here’s Bush. So Bush does an ad and he takes me and he was talking about, you know, something and he made a statement then I killed him...By the way, I’m at 69%. He’s at 1%. He got, he came in last. He takes the ad and I shouldn’t even talk about him. He’s down to two or three but it bothers me when I see a guy spending, you know, $60 million on ads against me a lot of it. Right?
