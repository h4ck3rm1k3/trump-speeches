In fact, I get criticized all the time. "You’re always talking about your polls." One of these guys has got 2%. He’s at 2%. I’m at 42%. And one of these guys who’s at 2% said "He always talks about his polls, and I don’t." And I wouldn’t either if I have 2%. I swear I wouldn’t. I wouldn’t. I wouldn’t do it at all.
