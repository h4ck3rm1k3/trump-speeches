When I become President, the days of treating Israel like a second-class citizen will end on Day One. And when I say something, I mean it. I mean it. I will meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu immediately. I have known him for many years and weâ€™ll be able to work closely together to help bring stability and peace to Israel and to the entire region.
