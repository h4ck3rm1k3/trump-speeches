They came up to my office, the head of Comcast – great guy – I won’t use names. Just say "Steve". No, honestly he’s a great guy. One of the best in the country. He came up with the heads of NBC six months ago and they said, "Donald, we’re renewing The Apprentice. Please, you’ll have to do – you have to do it."
