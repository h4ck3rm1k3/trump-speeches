I actually said – it’s funny. The other day, I got this great review. They said "Trump is a great speaker. The crowd is spellbound. But he has one problem." I’m reading. I want to see. "The problem is he speaks through the applause." In other words, I say that, you applaud, I start talking before you finish your applause. And you know why? Because I’m so excited because we have so much potential. It’s true. I don’t want to wait for your freaking applause. We have – I have so many. We have so much potential. There’s so many things to do. I don’t really sort of want to wait. I want to do it.
