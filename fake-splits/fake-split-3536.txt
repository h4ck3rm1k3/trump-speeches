And you say that. We have to get our prisoners back. Day one. They’re going to say, "No, we’re not giving." And we’re going to say, "Bye bye. Bye! Call us when you’re ready." And then we go out and double up and triple up the sanctions. I guarantee you within 48 hours they’re calling, begging us to come back to the table and you have your prisoners back. It’s so easy.
