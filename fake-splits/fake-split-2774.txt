But what I like is in Syria with other people’s money meaning the Gulf states and others and Germany and others because look Germany is paying a fortune to accept all these people. They’ll give us the money. We’d do a massive safe zone. And then eventually when this whole catastrophe straightens out, which I’ll probably be able to get it straightened out. I understand that stuff. But once it’s straightened out, they can go back home to their country. You know, to their area.
